# CEID-DATA-STRUCTURES-PROJECT-2022

This project was made for the second year undergraduate course "Data Structures" of the Computer Engineering & Informatics Department (CEID) of the University of Patras.

There is code for basic algorithms, such as:
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Binary Search
* Interpolation Search
* Binary Interpolation Search

As well as basic data structures:
* AVL tree
* Hash table with chains

All of the above are used to manage a .csv file containing information about water samples collected between 2000 and 2019 by California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (https://calcofi.org/)

## Code Structure

* Part_1: Sorting and Searching Algorithms
    * Part_1_1: Sorting data by temperature using Insertion Sort and Quicksort

    * Part_1_2: Sorting data by phosphate values using Heap Sort and Counting Sort

    * Part_1_3: Assuming data is sorted by date, use Binary Search and Interpolation Search to find temperature and phosphate values on a user-inputted date

    * Part_1_4: Same as 1_3, but with Binary Interpolation Search

* Part_2: AVL Trees (on date or temperature) and Hashing (on date)

## Execution

* Part_1_1: From inside Part_1/Part_1_1, run the following:
    ```bash
    gcc main_1_1_insertion.c
    
    ./a.out
    ```

* Part_1_2: From inside Part_1/Part_1_2, run the following:
    ```bash
    gcc main_1_2_counting.c

    ./a.out
    ```

* Part_1_3: From inside Part_1/Part_1_3, run the following:
    ```bash
    gcc main_1_3.c

    ./a.out
    ```

* Part_1_4: From inside Part_1/Part_1_4, run the following:
    ```bash
    gcc main_1_4.c

    ./a.out
    ```

* Part_2: From inside Part_2, run the following:
    ```bash
    gcc main_2.c

    ./a.out
    ```
