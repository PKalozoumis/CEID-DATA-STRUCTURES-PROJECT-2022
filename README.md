# CEID-DATA-STRUCTURES-PROJECT-2022

This project was made for the second year undergraduate course "Data Structures" of the Computer Engineering & Informatics Department (CEID) of the University of Patras.

There is code for basic algorithms, such as:
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Binary Search
* Interpolation Search
* Binary Interpolation Search

As well as basic data structures:
* AVL tree
* Hash table with chains

All of the above are used to manage a .csv file containing information about water samples collected between 2000 and 2019 by California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (https://calcofi.org/)
